# Flight rules for ODH

#### What are "flight rules"?

A [guide for astronauts](https://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/fr_generic.pdf) (now, programmers contributing to the Open Data Hub) about what to do when things go wrong. 

>  *Flight Rules* are the hard-earned body of knowledge recorded in manuals that list, step-by-step, what to do if X occurs, and why. Essentially, they are extremely detailed, scenario-specific standard operating procedures. [...]

> NASA has been capturing our missteps, disasters and solutions since the early 1960s, when Mercury-era ground teams first started gathering "lessons learned" into a compendium that now lists thousands of problematic situations, from engine failure to busted hatch handles to computer glitches, and their solutions.

&mdash; Chris Hadfield, *An Astronaut's Guide to Life*.
